\chapter{Shortest path}
\normalfont
This is no listed as part of the homeworks. But here are the implementations of some of the ``Shortest path'' algorithms and tools
that we reviewed in class. Again implemented in Octave (MathLab), and again, you can download the code from the github repository. \pn

The matrix tropical product implementation.
